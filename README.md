In this chapter I am testing and experimenting with some unsupervised learning technics like:</br>
</br>
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</br>
- Autoencoder</br>
- K-mean clustering</br>
</br>
Generative Adversarial Networks have been used in many different applications to generate realistic synthetic data.</br>
I saw that this technic works quite well if we have a huge collection of pictures for the tandem training, and if the pictures are</br>
quite similiar, for example they are just human faces. I was curious how the model performs if we have a small amount of pictures </br>
and if the object's or objects' position on the images are varying. I tested the model created in Pytorch on 210 dolphin images.</br>
